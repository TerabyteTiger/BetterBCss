# Better BCss

Improve BC with rainbows, gutter images, easier to read tables, and less wonky table scrolling!

## Setup

- Download this repo
- Update `manifest.json` by adding your Business Central URL to the `matches` property
- Save your changes

## Installation in Browser

- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or `edge:// extensions` in Edge (Chromium))
- Enable Developer Mode
- Turn on Developer Mode
- Click "Load Unpacked" and select this folder

## General Use

Once you have the extension installed, the default will be to display Nick Cage in the once empty space to bring some joy to your BC experience. If you would rather replace that with a different image, any URL can be set to your instance using the input field in the Extension Popup!
